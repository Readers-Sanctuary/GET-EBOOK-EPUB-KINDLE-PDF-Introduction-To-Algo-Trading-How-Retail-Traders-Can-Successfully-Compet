Title: For the first time EVER, a book that is actionable that can help you become succeessful
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020
Review: So i never write reviews so take this for what it's worth. I have purchased thousands of dollars of financial books. In fact i have an extremely large book case of only financial books in my office; from fundamentals to classics like investment valuation to nearly all of Buffet's books to Remininincenses of a stock operator to whole host of books in-between. Let me say this- the are all good They all offer solid advice oh physiology, risk management and everything in between topics. However, no book i have ever read is directly actionable in the market to make money. Saying risk management is the fundamental key to success is absolutely true but at the end of the day isn't all the actionable. Just sound advice which we should adhere to is great but nothing all that is all that concrete to be honest.

Kevin Davey in all his books breaks the mold. He gives sounds advice on how to make an algorithm trading system actionable. You need to gather specific ideas to tweak and modify to make your own and to ultimately implement strategies to make money- whether full time or the greatest side hustle of all time. Kevin is not going to give you code where you can copy and paste and make millions but will show you exactly how to get started and then let your own ideas take over.

If you have interest in the topic and actually have the wherewithal to get started, you should read one author and one author only and that is Kevin Daley. You may read it and never do anything with it or you may read it, take action and it might change your life forever where you can do great great things in life.

I choose to take action and hopefully make enough money where we can give significant money back to local causes and i would say if that comes true- it would be 100% because of Kevin and his writings and for that i just want to thank you.

EVERYYONE SHOULD START WITH BOOK AND HIS OTHERS.

Review: As a long time investor in stocks, mutual funds, options and most recently futures I was looking to learn more about Algorithmic trading for the retail trader and ran across Kevin Davey. I liked the fact that he emphasizes basic principles and setting realistic goals. Even stating that Algo trading is not for every investor and may not be for you. I was going to buy his first book but this one seemed more appropriate for me plus It was brand new. It is an up to date easy to read guide to the basics. Graphics are a little weak though, small and hard to see but he actually will send them all to you them as .tif files so you can see them clearly.
The book also provides step by step instructions in how to get started. I feel this book got me pointed in the right direction to begin developing my own strategies.

Title: Light on substance
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2019
Review: There‚Äôs not much to say about this book because there is very little of value in it. Most key terms are not explained (eg ‚Äúwalkforward testing‚Äù) and not a single example of a valuable strategy is given (in fact he specifically says the strategies shown do not work). While I appreciate this book isn‚Äôt meant to be a secret guide to trading, to not even discuss a single valuable trading strategy makes it difficult for the reader to even imagine what a successful strategy looks like in practice. Most of the book is meaningless fluff that one could pick up in any blog post online. However, if you are the rare reader who literally has never heard of alto trading before and want a fifth grade explanation of it to get you started, this book might be good for you, which is why I‚Äôve given it Teo stars instead of one.

Title: Accessible for Beginners but Missing Charts
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2021
Review: Appropriate for the beginner, and the writing style is very accessible for the ordinary person. Would have been great if more college text books were as easy to read. However, nearly all the pictures were missing in the Kindle version from Figure 5 to the end of the book, so you miss a lot of charts and diagrams.

Title: Truly A Great Place To Start
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2018
Review: Kevin's book opened my eyes to algo trading. I recently entered the algo marketplace only to get beat up and ended up exactly where I started. So to the uninitiated, I say hitch your wagon to a guy like Kevin. Drink deeply if you want to enter his domain and learn, This book is a great place to start. But makes this book a first step to the incredibly deep and complex world of Algo trading if you so desire.
